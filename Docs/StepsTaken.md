# Steps taken

## First things first

### Clean up

It is always better to have a fresh start.
So I deleted already existing VPC, 3 subnets, IGW, deactivated API key

### Set the repo

There are few folders in the repo
* **Docs** - documentation
* **Servers_conf** - configuration management playbooks
* **AWS_conf** - AWS configuration playbooks
* **Toolkit** - few scripts to use
